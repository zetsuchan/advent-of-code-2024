# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in three different languages:

- Rust
- Solidity
- Zig

## Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in its own directory (`day01`, `day02`, etc.) with three subdirectories for each implementation language. Each language-specific directory contains its own build system and tests.

## Running Solutions

### Rust Solutions
Navigate to the Rust directory for the specific day and run:
```bash
cargo run
```

### Solidity Solutions
Navigate to the Solidity directory for the specific day and run:
```bash
forge test
```

### Zig Solutions
Navigate to the Zig directory for the specific day and run:
```bash
zig build run
```

## Progress

- [x] Day 1
  - [ ] Rust Implementation
  - [ ] Solidity Implementation
  - [ ] Zig Implementation
